# React frontend development guidelines

Comprehensive development guidelines for React applications. Use this skill when the user needs to work with React code, i.e. `.jsx` and `.tsx` files.

## When to apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Creating new React components
- Implementing data fetching
- Refactoring existing React code

## How to use

Read individual reference files for detailed explanations and code examples. The references are grouped in the following categories:

| Category                | Importance | Prefix |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| React coding style      | CRITICAL   | style  |
| Typescript coding style | HIGH       | ts     |

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references
